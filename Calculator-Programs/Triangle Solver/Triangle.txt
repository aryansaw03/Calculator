 Triangle is a simple to use program that divides the problem of calculating the different
values of a triangle into five cases: SAS,SSA,ASA,SAA and SSS, depending on what information you have. Handles the ambiguous case.

 1:SAS
Two sides and the angle between.

 2:SSA
Two sides and the angle opposite to the first side. In this case there can be either 0,1 or 2 solutions.If there is no solution the calc. will show ERR:DOMAIN, if there are two solutions the program will show 1 OF 2 and 2 OF 2 for the respective solutions(the ambiguous case)

 3:ASA
One side and its adjacent angles.

 4:SAA
One side, the opposite angle and one adjacent angle.

 5:SSS
When you have the length of the three sides


 The program will ask for the specific information in each case. For example in case two:
2:SSA

GIVE TWO SIDES
AND THE ANGLE
OPP. TO SIDE1
SIDE1=


 The answer is showed with the Text( command. All three sides and angles plus the area are
shown on one screen:

SIDE1:A=5
SIDE2:B=10
SIDE3:C=8.660254

ANGLE1:D=30
ANGLE2:E=90
ANGLE3:F=60

AREA:G=21.650635
