1 Prop Z-Test:
1) Random sample
2) Sample < 10% of population | independence
3) np,nq >= 10

2 Prop Z-Test:
1) Random sample
2) Both sample < 10% of population | independence
3) np1,nq1,np2,nq2 >= 10

1 Sample T-Test:
1) Random sample
2) Sample < 10% of population | independence
3) Nearly normal | n >= 30 (Central Limit Theorem) | Check Boxplot or Histogram for Normal
**Remember to draw it^

2 Sample T-Test (Different Subjects):
1) Random sample
2) Both sample < 10% of population | independence
3) Nearly normal for both | n >= 30 for both (Central Limit Theorem) | Check Boxplot or Histogram for Normal for both
**Remember to draw it^

Paired T-Test (Same Subjects):
1) Random sample
2) Sample < 10% of population | differences are independent
3) Check Boxplot or Histogram for Normal for differences (L2-L1)
**Remember to draw it^

Chi-Square Test (All):
1) Random sample
2) Data given in counts (is the data countable?)
3) Sample < 10% of population | independence
4) Expected Values >= 5

Linear Regression T-Test:
1) Sample < 10% of population | independence
2) Scatterplot is rougly linear
3) Residual plot is random
4) Histogram of residuals is unimodal and mostly symetric
**Remember to draw it^
