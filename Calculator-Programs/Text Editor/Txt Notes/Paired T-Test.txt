**Same Subjects
Hypothesis:
HO: mu1 = mu2 or mu2-mu1 = 0
HA: mu1 >,<,!= mu2 or mu2-mu1 >,<,!= 0
**define mu1 and mu2

Conditions:
1) Random sample
2) Sample < 10% of population | differences are independent
3) Check Boxplot or Histogram for Normal for differences (L2-L1)
**Remember to draw it^

Mechanics:
invT() for t-crit or use table
SE of differences=S/sqrt(n)
S(standard deviation of differences)=
n=
x-bar of differences=
t=
p-val=
alpha=
**draw normal curve and shade in area
