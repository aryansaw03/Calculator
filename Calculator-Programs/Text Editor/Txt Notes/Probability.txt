Binomialcdf(N, P, X)
Probability of getting at most X things out of N number of items
1 - binomialcdf(N, P, X-1) for "at least"

Binomialpdf(N, P, X)
Probability of getting exactly X things out of N number of items

Geometricdf(P, N)
Probability of first success within/at most n number of trials
1-geometricdf(P, N) for "more than"

Geometricpdf (P, N)
Probability of first success is exactly on Nth try

Binomial- probability of getting this many things
Geometric- probability of first success
PDF- specific position
CDF- Cumulative
