Hypothesis:
HO: claim is true
HA: claim is false

Conditions:
1) Random sample
2) Data given in counts (is the data countable?)
3) Sample < 10% of population | independence
4) Expected Values >= 5

Mechanics:
Expected Values = (row total)*(col total)/(overall total)
df=(row-1)(col-1)
X^2 (Chi-square)=
p-val=
