**MAKE SURE TO CHECK CONDITIONS
Confidence Level Interpretation:
If we take many random samples of (n),
(confidence level)% of them would capture
the true (mean/proportion/difference) of (sample)

1 Prop Z-Test/1 Sample T-Test:
We are (confidence level)% confident that 
the true (proportion/mean) of (sample)
is within (confidence interval).

2 Prop Z-Test/2 Sample T-Test/Paired T-Test:
We are (confidence level)% confident that 
the (proportion/mean) of (group 1) is 
(1st number CI) (more (+)/less (-)) and 
(2nd number CI) (more (+)/less (-)) than
the (proportion/mean) of (group 2).

Linear Regression T-Test:
We are (confidence level)% confident that
(Y-Variable) changes on average between
(confidence interval) per (X Variable).
